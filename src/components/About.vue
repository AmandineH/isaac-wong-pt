          My name is Isaac Wong. Since 2017, I have been helping clients and
          athletes reach their fitness goals through science-based, sustainable
          & data-driven methods. Having been a competitive athlete across
          football, basketball and floorball throughout my schooling years, I
          have always been active and passionate about sports in general.
          However, with regards to exercising, my interest in bodyweight
          training was first sparked in 2014 when I was preparing to take the
          GCE 'A' Level examinations. Bodyweight training in the form of
          push-ups and pull-ups were a way for me to relax during that period. â€‹
        </p>

        <p class="body-2 mb-20px" :class="isLg ? 'text-black' : 'text-white'">
          I believe that being physically fit is something that everyone should
          be able to enjoy! With over 15 years of competitive sports experience
          and more than half a decade of professional fitness coaching under my
          belt, I believe that I have acquired the necessary skills to help any
          individual achieve his/her fitness goals!
