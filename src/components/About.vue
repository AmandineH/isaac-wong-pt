          I've been a competitive athlete since I was 10, playing Basketball,
          Football and Floorball up until National Service where I found my love
          for fitness and strength training. Since then, I've been called up to
          the national Powerlifting and Weightlifting team, as well as competed
          competitively in hybrid fitness sports such as CrossFit and Hyrox.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black text-md-regular mb-16px">
          My coaching career began in 2016 after I finished my service in the
          Military. I did personal training and online coaching while
          concurrently studying for a degree in economics and data science. Upon
          graduation, I took up a post graduate research scholarship to pursue a
          PhD in Economics but ultimately left the programme 6 months later to
          pursue my love for fitness fulltime.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black text-md-regular mb-16px">
          I have not looked back since and feel extremely fortunate everyday to
          be put in a position to directly change someone else's life for the
          better!
        </p>

        <p class="text-black text-md-regular mb-16px">
          With more than 7 years of experience in the fitness industry as a
          coach with multiple fitness entities, I am confident of the skills
          that I've developed to help anyone achieve their goals! Whether you're
          looking to lose weight, build muscle or get stronger and fitter for a
          sport, I'll be more than happy to journey alongside you!
        </p>

        <p class="text-black text-md-semibold mb-16px">
          Do reach out if you think that I might be a good fit to serve you. See
          you soon!
